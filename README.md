# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning
This project is about making a machine learning model to predicti house prices. In it, I create and evaluate a number of different models that use different algorithms, and compare and constrast their various results. The data used for this project is that of the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

NOTE: This notebook is an edited version of the original which I prepared for a school homework assignment. The original notebook can be found on my GitHub in my archived repository titled BYU 2019 Applied Machine Learning Classwork.
